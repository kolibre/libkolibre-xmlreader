What is Kolibre?
---------------------------------
Kolibre is a Finnish non-profit association whose purpose is to promote
information systems that aid people with reading disabilities. The software
which Kolibre develops is published under open source and made available to all
stakeholders at github.com/kolibre.

Kolibre is committed to broad cooperation between organizations, businesses and
individuals around the innovative development of custom information systems for
people with different needs.


History
---------------------------------
The software development started in 2002 by Norra Österbottens Svenska 
Synskadade rf (NÖSS), a Finnish non-profit contact, interest and service 
organization for visually impaired. NÖSS sought for a solution together with 
Jakobstads Tidning (today Österbottens Tidning)to modernize the daily talking 
newspaper which back then was distributed by tape.

Since then several projects, mainly funded by the Finnish Slot Machine 
Association, have been carried out in conjunction with other partners (i.e. 
Pratsam Ab) to improve and further develop the software for different needs:

  2003-2004:
  Den Digitala Taltidningen, (Eng. The digital talking newspaper)

  2005-2006:
  Digital Service för Synskadade, (Eng. Digital Services For Visually Impaired)

  2007-2008:
  Ett tillgängligt informationssamhälle, (Eng. An Accessible Information Society)

  2009-2012:
  Hjälpmedel för jämställdhet, (Eng. Aids For Equality)


What is Kolibre-xmlreader?
---------------------------------
Kolibre-xmlreader is a library for fetching and parsing XML data. Kolibre-
xmlreader is a SAX wrapper library for libxml2. The Kolibre-xmlreader can load 
XML/XHTML/HTML documents from disk or http. A caching function is built in to 
speed up re-parsing of previous XML documents. Kolibre-xmlreader also has an 
optional dependency on libtidy. Libtidy can be used as a fallback for cleaning 
up messy and malformed XML files. These features makes the usage of xmlreader 
simple, fast and reliable.

see INSTALL for detailed instructions.


Known issues
---------------------------------
There is currently a bug in libxml2 version 2.7.8 causing xml parsing to fail
when the document type declaration contains an empty internal subset declaration.
If this package is compiled with libtidy then tidy will remove the empty
declaration and thus work normally.

The bug has been reported to the libxml2 community along with a patch. Visit
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=684201 to check the status of the bug
or download the patch.
